# Computational-DB-System-
Developed a real-time application for automating college digital records, incorporating user and admin portals with secure authentication, under the guidance of Professor Dr. Dheerendra Singh. The objective of the project is to digitize the computational data of the college and provide easy access to all faculty members.     

This website is designed to provide a database for CCET employees so that they do not have to take on the burden of keeping hardcopies of computational goods in store and in use. This webpage provides information about various products used by CCET (Degree Wing) and who is allocated to them.

This project was created utilising several different programming languages, tools, and technologies. Each of them supplied distinct functionality and features that benefited in the development of a project with simplified code and easy comprehension. The following are some of the languages and technologies that were employed in this project.  
i) HTML
ii) CSS
iii) Java Script
iv) PHP
v) MySQL
